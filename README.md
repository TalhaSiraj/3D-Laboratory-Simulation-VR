# 3D-Laboratory-Simulation-VR

I have just included my scripts as this was a company project which i was also heading as a Project manager.

Made with Unity the interactive virtual laboratory work of robotics experiment with simulation and 3D is developed. It is shown that it could be useful learning tool for visualizing interaction methods, instruments and aids during working with unique equipment. Checklist instructions combined with the 3D graphics for execution of virtual laboratory in preparation for the real experiment with unique equipment is offered. It provides the ability of interaction with virtual laboratory objects and tools much more efficiently.

As well as deepening knowledge with the use of mathematical modeling, simulation and interactive 3D animation of complex physical processes. Developed virtual laboratory functioning is possible autonomously as well as in virtual learning environment.  A three-dimensional model of the virtual installation which completely corresponds to the real installation, to make measurements using the original digitized samples is created. The possibility of comparing virtual measurement data with the results of real experiments is realized.
